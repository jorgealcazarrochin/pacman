# PacMan
## In this exercise, we are developing a game in which we control multiple Pac-Mans. These Pac-Man move within an area delimited by vertical and horizontal walls, and the objective is to bounce them off these walls. The cool feature of this game is that we can add more Pac-Man at any time, which adds a dynamic element to the challenge.

# How to Run
